## User stories

```
As a user,
so that I can access the acebook app
I'd like to use acebook as a Heroku app

As a user,
so that I can be an acebook user,
I'd like to sign up to acebook

As a user,
So that I can log in to acebook,
I'd like to be able to sign in

As a user,
So that I can get rid of that embarrassing post,
I'd like to be able to delete a post.

As a user,
So that I can quickly change that post to an even better one,
I'd like to be able to edit a post.

As a user,
So that I can cling to some fading sense of time,
I'd like to see the times which posts were made at.

As a user,
So that I can maintain some order in this increasingly chaotic world,
I'd like to see posts in chronological order.

As a user,
So that all the posts don't blur into one and look really messy,
I'd like to have line breakers between each post.

As a users,
So that other people can't ruin my image,
I'd like users to only be able to edit and delete their own posts.
